      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

      <p class="lede">
        This page provides documentation of the data sources and analytical
        methods that have been developed to create
        this updated version of the California Center for Sustainable
        Communities’ Solar Opportunity Tool.</p>
      <p>Financial support for the
        development of this tool has been provided by a research grant from
        the California Governor's Office of Planning and Research's
        Strategic Growth Council (SGC). </p>

      <h2 id="keydata">Key Datasets and Assumptions</h2>

      <h3>Eligible Site Selection</h3>
      <p>
        The new design plan for the updated solar opportunity tool includes
        the following criteria which are used for initial identification of
        “eligible sites” for the development of community scale solar generation
        assets. The criteria of eligibility are listed below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Eligible sites should be of an intermediate scale, ranging in size
          from ~50 kW-DC to ~5 MW-DC (50 MW-DC max.) in nameplate capacity.</li>
        <li> Eligible sites should be restricted to publicly owned or community
          oriented institutional facilities with existing buildings and parking
          lots. This requirement is meant to ensure that the development of
          solar PV assets on these sites will be categorically exempt from
          California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review requirements -
          meaning ground mounted arrays on previously undeveloped lands are out
          of scope.</li>
        <li> Eligible sites should possess existing metered electricity
          accounts. The requirement is meant to ensure that there are
          available one or more existing accounts that could be used in
          conjunction with the VNM pilot. The existence of metered electricity
          accounts on a site will be inferred from the presence of buildings
          larger than 400 ft^s in footprint area.</li>
        <li> External accounts considered eligible for participating a VNM
          program in conjunction with the development of a community scale
          solar PV asset on any particular site will be restricted to those
          which are connected to the same local distribution circuit as the
          eligible site in question. This is meant to minimize the potential
          risks of experiencing reverse power flows along any particular
          circuit in the event of a temporary imbalance between supply and
          demand.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Grid Infrastructure Capacity</h3>
      <p>
        Grid infrastructure capacity metrics for each distribution circuit
        have been developed by the local investor owned utility, Southern
        California Edison (SCE), as part of an integrated capacity assessment
        performed in support of their distributed energy resource planning
        efforts. Within SCE service territory, the most important single
        capacity metric
        for distributed energy resource planning is what is known as the 15%
        penetration capacity. Rule 21, which details utility procedures and
        requirements for the submission of distributed energy resource grid
        integration requests, dictates that the total combined nameplate
        capacity of all generation assets connected to each distribution
        circuit must not exceed 15% of the historical maximum load experienced
        on that circuit over the previous ~18 months.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of this analysis, each eligible site must therefore be
        associated with its proximal distribution circuit in order to assess the
        extent to which the full development of that site's available solar PV
        generation potential will or will not exceed the 15% penetration limit.
        Additionally, local residential accounts must also be associated with
        their proximal circuits in order to determine which accounts can
        potentially be served by a VNM scheme implemented at any individual
        candidate site. These circuit-to-site and circuit-to-account
        relationships have all been assigned on the basis of minimum geographic
        distance. This is the same allocation procedure used by (Porse et al.
        2020).
      </p>

      <h3>Site Net Generation Potential</h3>
      <p>
        Two types of solar PV systems are considered by the tool: rooftop and
        parking canopy mounted systems. As rooftops are existing structures that
        can be remotely sensed using aerial/satellite imagery & LiDAR, there are
        established methods for calculating the capacity potentials of rooftop
        mounted PV. These methods account for roof size, orientation, obstacles,
        and local shading factors. The rooftop solar capacity potentials of all
        of the buildings within Los Angeles County have already been estimated
        using these methods as part of the development of the Los Angeles County
        Solar Map. This data has been leveraged as part of this analysis to
        provide a comprehensive estimate of the total combined rooftop system
        capacity associated with all of the buildings located on each eligible
        site.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to rooftop PV system capacities, the availability of
        detailed information about the geographic extents of parking lots within
        the region creates the opportunity to assess the additional capacity
        potential of canopy mounted systems as well. However, as canopy
        structures must be fabricated, and thus, do not yet exist, procedures
        for estimating their potential capacity are not as well-established, nor
        are similar estimates for LA County buildings readily available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our approach to estimating the capacity potential of parking lot
        canopy structure mounted systems on eligible candidate sites will
        involve approximating the range of existing parking lot area that
        could be potentially be covered by canopy structures. These "site
        density factors" will be based on an analysis of the ratio of
        available parking lot areas to installed canopy structure areas for
        existing generator facilities which have already been installed
        throughout the region as well as a review of the academic literature
        on the design and performance characteristics of such "carport" solar
        PV systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        This range of values is based on an analysis of the ratio of available
        parking lot areas to installed canopy structure areas for existing
        generator facilities which have throughout the region as well as a
        review of the academic literature on the design and performance
        characteristics of such "carport" solar PV systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this range of canopy structure footprint area estimates has been
        established, these values can then be multiplied by a corresponding set
        of "panel density factors" which reflect the total panel area that can
        be installed on the footprint area of a given canopy structure. Finally,
        once this range of estimates for the total panel area have been
        established, the output of these panels can be modeled using solar
        insolation and system performance characteristics for the site's
        location using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's PVWatts Model
        API.
      </p>
      <p>
        While these approximation techniques are admittedly coarse, they should
        be useful in providing an order of magnitude level estimate of the
        potential for parking lot canopy structures to contribute to a site's
        total solar PV generation capacity potential. This is increasingly
        becoming an essential consideration as parking lot canopy structure
        mounted systems have grown in popularity throughout the region in recent
        years.

      <p><b>Residential Per-Capita Energy Intensity</b></p>
      <p>
        Account level residential energy consumption data from the UCLA Energy
        Atlas are aggregated to the Census Block Group level. Once the total
        annual residential consumption for each block group has been computed,
        this value is then divided by the block group's population to estimate
        average per-capita residential electricity demands. These average
        per-capita consumption figures will then be linked to nearby eligible
        sites on the basis of shared distribution circuit association. In this
        way, for each eligible site, annual estimates of solar PV system
        generation capacity potential will be able to be compared to the average
        residential energy use in the local area on a per-capita and
        per-household basis.

        are generally large utility scale assets which sell power to the grid
        at wholesale rates. Each facility is coded by fuel type and has listed
        as an attribute its nameplate generation capacity. The locations of
        these existing large scale, in-front of the meter solar PV generators
        within LA County will be cross-referenced with the locations of
