      <p class="lede">Where are opportunities to install community

      <p>Find eligible sites for community
        solar in your city with this map tool.</p>
      <p>Panels on the right side of the map help
        filter and narrow locations based on criteria important to your solar
        installation site.</p>

      <p><a href="#map" role="button">Go to Map</a></p>

      <p>Tutorials are provided below to help you get started:</p>

      <button class="accordion">Find sites within my city</button>
      <div class="panel">
      
        <ol>
          <li>To focus the map on your city of interest, type your city in the
            search bar, located in the bottom left corner of the map or zoom
            into your city on the map.</li>
          <li>Open the City widget. Click "Search in 87 Categories." Type your
            city in the search bar.</li>
          <li> Once it appears in the list, click the check box to the left.
            Click Apply in the upper-left corner of the widget.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now, only eligible sites within your city are shown on the map.
          Other widgets will reflect this filter. You can now see the
          distribution of other available datasets for sites located only in
          your city. Because filters are added cumulatively, making a
          selection in an additional widget will further refine the selected
          sites.</p>
        <p>To undo your selection, click “Unlock” in the widget.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Find sites within Clean Power Alliance (CPA)
        Territory</button>
      <div class="panel">
       
        <ol>
          <li>Scroll to and open the "CPA Territory" widget.</li>
          <li>Eligible sites are divided into two categories: true where the
            site is located within CPA territory, and false where it is
            outside CPA territory.</li>
          <li>Click "true." Now, only eligible sites within CPA territory are
            shown on the map. Filtering with additional widgets will further
            refine your selected sites.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To undo this step, click "All" within the CPA Territory widget.</p>

          <li>Scroll to and open the "Sufficient Circuit Capacity" widget.
          </li>
          <li>Eligible sites are divided into two cateogires: true where the
            site has sufficient circuit capacity, and false where it does not.
          </li>
          <li>Click "true." Now, only eligible sites with sufficient circuit
            capacity are shown on the map. Filtering with additional widgets
            will further refine your selected sites.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To undo this step, click "All" within the Sufficient Circuit
          Capacity widget.</p>

        Potential (MW)</button>

        <ol>
          <li>Scroll to and open the Combined Capacity Potential (MW) widget.
          </li>
          <li>A histogram shows the distribution of combined capacity
            potential (MW) in each eligible site shown on the map.</li>
          <li>Click on the histogram and two range bars appear. Drag the bars
            to capture the highest range of values or the values you are most
            interested in.</li>
          <li>Now, only eligible sites with a combined capacity potential
            within the range you have set in the histogram are available.
            Filtering with additional widgets will further refine your
            selected sites.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To undo this step, click "Clear" within the Combined Capacity
          Potential widget. To see a histogram of just your selected values,
          click "Zoom."</p>

            overview of the DAC Census Tracts in Los Angeles County.</li>
          <li>Scroll to and open the "CalEnviroscreen 3.0 Scores" widget. This
            widget filters eligible sites based on the CalEnviroscreen score
            of the census tract it is located within.</li>
          <li>Click the histogram and two range bars appear. Drag the bars to
            capture the eligible sites with a CalEnviroscreen score between 75
            and 100. The eligible sites now overlap with the DAC Census Tract
            layer available in the legend.</li>
          <li>Turn off the "DAC Census Tracts" layer. Click the rain drop
            above the histogram to apply the color style. Now only eligible
            sites located in a census tract with a CalEnviroscreen score
            between 75 and 100 are available and colored gradiently by score.
            Filtering with additional widgets will further refine your
            selected sites.</li>

            census tract.</li>
          <li>Scroll to and open the "Local Renter Household Offset" widget.
