      <p class="lede">Where are opportunities to install community
        solar?</p>
      <p>Find eligible sites for community
        solar in your city with the map tool below.</p>
      <p>Eligible sites are publicly owned or community oriented institutional
        facilities with existing buildings and parking lots. Panels on the right side of the map help
        filter and narrow locations based on criteria important to your solar
        installation site. LADWP service territory is grayed out because key data inputs about grid
        distribution circuit capacities were unavailable.</p>

      <p>Please note that 100% screen resolution is most ideal for using the map.</p>

      <h1>Get Started:</h1>

      <button class="accordion">Find sites within my city</button>
      <div class="panel">

        <ol>
          <li>There are two ways to focus the map on your city of interest. Use the search
            bar, located in the bottom left corner of the map. Type in your city and hit "Enter." This will
            zoom you into the city of interest and add a red pin.You can also manually zoom into a city with
            your mouse or using the "+/-" zoom tools next to the search bar.</li>
          <li>After zooming to your city, open the City filter. Click "Search in 87 Categories." Type your
            city in the search bar.</li>
          <li> Once it appears in the list, it will be greyed out, click the check box to the left to select.
            Click Apply in the upper-left corner of the filter.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now, only eligible sites within your city are shown on the map.
          Other filters will reflect this change. You can now see the
          distribution of other available datasets for sites located only in
          your city. Because filters are added cumulatively, making a
          selection in an additional filter will further refine the selected
          sites.</p>
        <p>To undo your selection, click “Unlock” in the filter.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Find sites within Clean Power Alliance (CPA)
        Territory</button>

        <ol>
          <li>Scroll to and open the "CPA Territory" filter.</li>
          <li>Eligible sites are divided into two categories: true where the
            site is located within CPA territory, and false where it is
            outside CPA territory.</li>
          <li>Click "true." Now, only eligible sites within CPA territory are
            shown on the map. Using additional filters will further
            refine your selected sites.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To undo this step, click "All" within the CPA Territory filter.</p>

          <li>Scroll to and open the "Sufficient Circuit Capacity" filter.
          </li>
          <li>Eligible sites are divided into two categories: true where the
            site has sufficient grid circuit capacity to accomodate solar PV,
            and false where it does not.
          </li>
          <li>Click "true." Now, only eligible sites with sufficient circuit
            capacity are shown on the map. Using additional filters
            will further refine your selected sites.</li>

          <li>Scroll to and open the Combined Capacity Potential (MW) filter.
          </li>
          <li>A histogram shows the distribution of combined capacity
            potential (MW) in each eligible site shown on the map.</li>
          <li>Click on the histogram and two range bars appear. Drag the bars
            to capture the highest range of values or the values you are most
            interested in.</li>
          <li>Now, only eligible sites with a combined capacity potential
            within the range you have set in the histogram are available.
            Using additional filters will further refine your
            selected sites.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To undo this step, click "Clear" within the Combined Capacity
          Potential filter. To see a histogram of just your selected values,
          click "Zoom."</p>

          <li>Go to the legend on the left side of the map. Click the check
            box next to "DAC Census Tracts." This layer is provided as an
            overview of the DAC Census Tracts in Los Angeles County.</li>
          <li>Scroll to and open the "CalEnviroscreen 3.0 Scores" filter. This
            histogram filters eligible sites based on the CalEnviroscreen score
            of the census tract it is located within.</li>
          <li>Click the histogram and two range bars appear. Drag the bars to
            capture the eligible sites with a CalEnviroscreen score between 75
            and 100. The eligible sites now overlap with the DAC Census Tract
            layer available in the legend.</li>
          <li>Turn off the "DAC Census Tracts" layer. Click the rain drop
            above the histogram to apply the color style. Now only eligible
            sites located in a census tract with a CalEnviroscreen score
            between 75 and 100 are available and colored gradiently by score.
            Using additional filters will further refine your
            selected sites.</li>

        <p>To undo this step, click "Clear" within the CalEnviroscreen 3.0
